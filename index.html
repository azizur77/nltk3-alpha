<h1>NLTK 3.0 Alpha Releases</h1>

<p>NLTK 3.0 is the first version of NLTK to support Python 3.
<b>This version of NLTK is likely to contain bugs.</b>
The alpha releases are for people who would like to help us identify and fix them
(by submitting bug reports and patches on <a href="https://github.com/nltk/nltk/">GitHub</a>).
All contributions will be acknowledged.

<h2>Release Notes</h2>

<p>The NLTK 3.0.X series will support Python 2.6 and 2.7 as well as Python 3.</p>

<p>The most observable change to the API is that Unicode strings are now used throughout.
The following are dropped: Tkinter graphical interfaces; babelize; sourcedstrings;
interface to scipy's deprecated maximum entropy classifier. (Note that Tkinter is not
supported because there are incompatible changes between Python 2 and 3 Tkinter libraries.)

<p>Most of the effort has gone into implementing the syntactic changes required for Python 3
and improving our test suite. The latter will make it easier to maintain NLTK into the future.
